16-bit microcomputer CPU designed by Motorola to compete with the MOS 6502 and compatible with Motorola 6800. It resembles it in many ways, but it has more registers.
A and B registers are the inputs of the ALU, being 8 bits each. They can be accessed like a single 16-bit register called D.
The S register is a counter that indexes the call stack. It's used for various system functions.
The U register is a counter intended for the user to set up their own stack.
X and Y are other counter registers for general purpose use.
The DP register means 'Direct Page' and fast memory reading instructions will use its value as the most significant half of the address to be used in memory.
